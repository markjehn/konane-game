      <h2>History of Konane</h2>
      <p>
        Konane is a traditional Hawaiian board game, sometimes called Hawaiian Checkers. It dates back over 1,000 years and was played by the ancient Polynesians who settled the Hawaiian Islands. The game was not only a pastime but also an important cultural activity, reflecting strategic thinking and social interaction.

        The game board typically consists of a grid filled with black and white stones arranged in alternating patterns. Players take turns jumping over their opponentâ€™s stones, capturing them, similar to checkers. Konane is believed to have originated before Western contact and was historically played by both chiefs and commoners.
